(10 pts) Chapter 1 discusses declarative vs. imperative knowledge. How would you explain the difference?
Declarative knowledge are observable facts.
Imperative knowledge is knowledge of the processes to complete a task or achieve a goal.

(You are invited to read, understand, then summarize in your own words, rather than copying verbatim from the book.)

(10 pts) How would you explain the difference between fixed-program and stored-program computers?
Stored program computers act as "interpreters" and are able to read new code to run programs after creation.
Fixed program computers are created with specific intent and are only able to complete those tasks and nothing else.
(10 pts) In the context of describing the Church-Turing thesis, Guttag mentions that some functions are “not computable”, and gives an example. What is this example of an “uncomputable function”?
This example is the halting problem which basically determines if a program is finite.
(10 pts) Computer Science professors and students tend to argue a lot about whether one programming language is “better” than another.
What is the signficance of the notion of Turing Completeness to this kind of discussion?
Because every language is turing complete, every language is essentially equal in computing power 
So far, we’ve provided some questions to guide your reading. However, in many university level courses, you’ll need to develop the skill of deciding for yourself what the important parts are in a reading passage.

Please read the rest of the material on pages 4, 5 and 6 and provide your own summary of what you think the most important concepts on these pages are, confining that summary to the space provided below. For each important concept, also come up with a practice quiz/exam question you might pose to a friend if you were helping them study.

You may want to write out your answers on scratch paper first, then copy them to the space below.

Syntax
Basically gives basic structure to combinations and orderings of values and operations
IE: 7 - 5 is valid because it is an accepted combinatio

Static Semantics

Basically further specifies meanings of combinations of values and operations
Ex: 3 + fox is not valid but 3 + 3 is 

Semantics in English are highly important to meaning even with the same words but in programming each should result in a unique result
This makes semantic errors much more dangerous than syntax errors which are easily fixed.
