1. To find the absolute smallest number of coins, you must use a recursive function. First, use as many octels as you can, and compare that number of coins to a set of coins with max number of (octels-1). If there are pennies left continue recursively along this function. Only exit if, the first set is smaller than the second set, there are no pennies left, or the number of octels has recursed to 0. This should guarantee you find the smallest number of coins for any possible N cents.
    2. Moving only up or left, start from the bottom right, compare the cost of the two paths you could take. Move to the path of least resistance, if they are equal, both could be taken. Continue this process for each intersection until you reach the top. If you have multiple paths, compare their cost and choose the smallest one.
