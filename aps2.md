1. To find the absolute smallest number of coins, you must use a recursive function. First, use as many octels as you can, and compare that number of coins to a set of coins with max number of (octels-1), and use as many nickels as possible to split the sum and continue it recursively.
    2. Start from the Top and work your way down numbering each step you take. Each intersection has 3 possibilities, Down(D), Diagonal(Di), and Right(R).Put each path in terms of letter combinations, so D Di R R, is equivalent to Down Diagonal Right Right. To calculate the cost of this path you would just add the path D Di R + R because you would already have calculated D Di R earlier in the process. This should take N ** 2 steps.
