1. To find the absolute smallest number of coins, you must use a recursive function. First, use as many octels as you can, and compare that number of coins to a set of coins with max number of (octels-1). Continue this process recursively until there are no pennies left then find the minimum # of coins among the sets you create., and that is your answer
    2. Moving only up or left, start from the bottom right, compare the cost of the two paths you could take. Move to the path of least resistance, if they are equal, both could be taken. Continue this process for each intersection until you reach the top. If you have multiple paths, compare their cost and choose the smallest one.
